# variable and assignment
# a variable stores data value 
# python is dynamically typed language meaning u dont have to declare a data type explicitly 

# assignment 
# an operator is used to assign values to variables

# keyword 
# words in pyhon that hae special meanings like if , else ,elif while , etc

# built in functions 
# python provides built in functions to simplify tasks 
# ex: print, len, sum , max ,min etc 

# Indentation
# we use indentation  at the beginning of lines to define code blocks  instead of {} in other languages 
# standard indentation in python is 4 spaces 

# comments 
# comments are used to explain what the code does 
# comments dont affect the execution of the code 
# we use  # or """"   """" to comment 

# instead of writing complete code , built in function perform tasks quickly 
# they used optimized algortihms that require reduced memory
# they minimize the chances if bugs

# How Indentation in Python is Different
# Unlike other languages like C or Java, Python does not use {} or ; for blocks of code.
# Instead, indentation (spaces) is used to define code blocks.

# Built-in Functions vs Custom Functions
# Built-in functions (print(), len(), sum()) save time.
# Custom functions are useful for special tasks not covered by built-in functions.
    
# When to Use Built-in vs Custom?

# Use built-in functions for common tasks like finding length, sum, etc.
# Write custom functions when built-in functions donâ€™t solve your problem.
